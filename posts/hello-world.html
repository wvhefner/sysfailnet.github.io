          <h1 class="post-title">hello, world — why I'm writing here</h1>
          <p class="post-lede">Every blog starts somewhere. Here's what this one is about and what I expect to write.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="prose">
          <p>I've started blogs before. Usually they die within a few months — the posts get more ambitious, the drafts pile up, and eventually the gap between what I want to write and what I actually write becomes too wide to close.</p>

          <p>This time I'm trying something different: lower expectations, shorter posts, less polish. A place to put things down and move on. If a post is three paragraphs and mostly correct, that's good enough.</p>

          <h2>What this is</h2>
          <p>Primarily a technical blog. I spend most of my time working with Linux systems, writing Python, and poking at security tooling. That's mostly what I'll write about.</p>

          <p>I'll also write shorter pieces when something is interesting enough to note down. Not every post needs a thesis.</p>

          <h2>What this isn't</h2>
          <p>A content strategy. A personal brand. A tutorial site optimized for search traffic.</p>

          <p>If you find something here useful, great. But I'm writing primarily to think out loud, and secondarily to have a record of what I figured out.</p>

          <hr>

          <p>The site is static HTML hosted on GitHub Pages. No framework, no CMS, no comment system. Writing happens in a text editor; publishing is a <code>git push</code>. Roughly as simple as it gets — and that simplicity is part of the point.</p>
